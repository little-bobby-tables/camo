# camo

Head over to the [main repository](https://github.com/atmos/camo) for more
information on Camo.

This repository is intended for keeping a tiny, up-to-date Docker image running
the proxy on the latest version of Node (currently 8.1).

It is available as [littlebobbytables/camo](https://hub.docker.com/r/littlebobbytables/camo/).

## Image size

Reducing the image size is one of the main goals of this fork.
Thanks to a lightweight base, it is **90% smaller** than the most
pulled camo image on Docker Hub:
